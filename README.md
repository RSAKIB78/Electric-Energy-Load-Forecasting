# Electric Energy Consumption Load Forecasting

This project simulates a scenario to demostrate how energy providers can use predictive modeling to forecast short-term load demand using historical consumption data.


# Machine Learning Model Training and Evaluation

The project makes use of training and evaluating machine learning models using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

## Project Structure

- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `dataset.csv`: The main dataset used for training and testing the models.
- `test_dataframes.xlsx`: Excel file containing test data.
- `train_dataframes.xlsx`: Excel file containing training data.
- `weekly pre-dispatch forecast.csv`: Additional dataset for forecasting.
- `LICENSE`: MIT License for the project.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
```

# Usage
Open the main.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

Models Used
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
